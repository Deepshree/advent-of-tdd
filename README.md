## Exercise 2
### Part 1: Spike - Reading in Input

Reading input from a file in Java is not always straight forward.
There will often be times that it is difficult to figure out which library you need or how to do something.
In this Exercise we will create a spike, in this spike we're exploring without any pressure to test.
You should experiment how to read the input file in `/src/main/resources/day1-elf-calories.txt` into a `Collection<Elf>`.

Spikes are a useful way to explore before we write our tests.
