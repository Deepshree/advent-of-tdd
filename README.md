## Exercise 4

Were you able to get your first `Star`? If the result wasn't correct try taking a look at our `Solution` we have change the `day1-elf-calories.txt` to our personal input so you should get an anser of `70613`. If you don't try comparing your `Solution` implementation to ours to see where you may have gone wrong.

### A New Part of the Problem

[Part 2](/day1-part2.md) brings in a change in the requirements, just like real life! 
The change is quite easy to implement, we now need to find the top 3 total calories for the Elves.
Let's add a new test to `TestElfCalorieCounter` to finish today's puzzle.
You can find the solution in the [final](https://github.com/rocketstack-matt/advent-of-tdd/tree/final-refactor) branch.

A big part of TDD is following the Red, Green, Refactor processes.
Spend some time working through both the tests and the subject under test and refactor as necessary.
